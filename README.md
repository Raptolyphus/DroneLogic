# DroneLogic
Rapto's drone logic in python

This repo is basically just me trying to figure out python while coding the logic of a drone
didn't involve any AIs.
Btw I coded all this stupid shit while on a ride from italy to germany
i could've chatted with girls or sth but I just did this stupid thing

you can use every part of this code btw
i dont mind anyone copying sth
if i helped someone new to python that's fine
if you're really into python or coding and general and you were just laughing at my miserable skills, that's fair and 
that's what i made this repo for
